## Biography

Hey there! I'm Likith Shet, a passionate software engineer focused on creating user-friendly, scalable, and innovative web and mobile applications. I’m currently interning with [Section Infin-8 Foundation](https://sectioninfin8.org/) as an Application Developer and Digital Marketing Analyst, where I have developed impactful mobile applications like ReimburseIt (a role-based reimbursement app) and VSmartCard Scanner (a visiting card scanner with OCR and smart organization features).

My development journey began with [DevNation AJIET](https://github.com/Ajiet-DevNation), a student-led tech community where I contributed to projects like a chatbot, portfolio site, and quiz app, while also participating in hackathons to enhance my skills. I'm currently pursuing a B.E. in Information Science and Engineering at [AJIET](https://www.ajiet.edu.in/), where I’ve built strong technical foundations and served as a campus ambassador for multiple companies, connecting peers with valuable tech opportunities.

I'm also honored to have been selected as the [GDG (Google Developer Groups) On Campus](https://gdg.community.devgdg-on-campus-a-j-institute-of-engineering-and-technology-mangaluru-india/) Organizer at AJIET, where I help foster a local developer community by organizing events, workshops, and initiatives to inspire and empower fellow students in tech.

Outside of coding, I’m a graphite portrait artist who enjoys creating realistic sketches. I believe that art and technology complement each other, sparking creativity and innovation in every project I undertake.
